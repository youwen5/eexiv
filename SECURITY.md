## Supported Versions

As this is a web application, only the latest deployed version will be monitored and updated for security vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In the interest of open disclosure, you are welcome to write a research paper on any vulnerabilities you discover.
In fact, we encourage you to exploit them if possible to demonstrate their potential impact.
We are not particularly concerned with DevSecOps, so these "security vulnerabilities" are not a primary concern for us.
Once you are done hacking our entire system, politely report the vulnerability securely via GitHub's private reporting system (recommended) or file a public issue and tell the world about it.
We really don't care.
