# eeXiv<sup>2</sup>

eeXiv just got better

---

eeXiv<sup>2</sup> (pronounced "EECS-iv"[^1]) is Team 1280's locally-hosted curated research-sharing platform. It is the successor to the original eeXiv, whose design was so terrible it was redesigned within 24 hours.
It is maintained by the Team 1280 EECS ("Electrical Engineering and Computer Science") team, which is also the greatest contributor of its research papers.
However, this repository is open for anyone—in Team 1280, in another FRC team, or as independent hobbyists—to contribute.
eeXiv borrows from a pioneer in digital open access, arXiv.org, and hosts the most FRC-specific scholarly articles in numerous subject areas, curated by our strong community of volunteer moderators.

[^1]: Whichever idiot decided "arXiv" should be pronounced like "archive" can cope; eeXiv is not changing its name or pronunciation.
